# lamoda-ai-fitting

Monorepo: `api` (NestJS) and `web` (Next.js), delivered to https://lamoda-ai-fitting.ru: every
merge into `main` is checked and deployed automatically. Set up by spec `0001-bootstrap` (closed).

Keep this file true: update it in the same commit that changes what a section describes.

## Where the truth is

- Code, this file and `README.md` are the living source of truth.
- `specs/NNNN-*/` hold the history of decisions. A spec folder whose files say `Status: done` is
  history, not instructions: never follow or edit it. While a spec is in progress, its
  `clarifications.md` (owner's decisions), `plan.md` and `tasks.md` are binding.
- How specs are written and closed: `specs/principles.md`.
- To look something up in the specs, delegate to the `spec-finder` agent (`.claude/agents/`) instead
  of reading spec files in the main context: it returns quotes with `path:line`, each marked binding
  or history.

## How work is done

- Spec → clarifications → plan → tasks → code. No code without an accepted plan.
- Decisions that change behavior belong to the owner: ask, record the answer in
  `clarifications.md`, do not pick silently.
- One task from `tasks.md` = one commit; tick its checkbox in the same commit.
- Before a task: state a time estimate. After it: stop, summarize what changed and the check result,
  wait for the owner's OK, then commit.
- If a task shows the plan is wrong: stop, fix the plan with the owner, then continue.

## Agents

Subagents in `.claude/agents/` work in their own context and return a short report. Delegate to them
instead of doing their job in the main context.

- `spec-finder`: facts from the specs and docs (read-only).
- `test-writer`: writes and runs api tests after the logic is implemented. A hook
  (`.claude/hooks/test-writer-guard.sh`) limits it to test files and test, typecheck and lint
  commands; it reports bugs instead of fixing code.
- `code-reviewer`: reviews a diff against this file and the active spec (read-only).

## Stack and versions

Pinned on purpose; each "not newer" has a reason and a condition to move on.

## Commands (from the root)

- `npm ci`: install; also sets git hooks (`core.hooksPath .githooks`).
- `npm run format` / `format:check`: Prettier on the whole repo.
- `npm run lint`: ESLint for root, `api` and `web` (one config, `eslint.config.mjs`).
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`: for every package that has them.
- `npm run verify`: format check, lint, typecheck, tests and build in one command. The pre-push
  hook and CI run exactly this, so the list of checks lives in one place (root `package.json`).

`verify` covers `api` (lint, typecheck, tests, build) and `web` (lint, Stylelint, typecheck,
`next build`). `web` has no tests yet: when its first test lands, add `web` to the root `test`
script, or `verify` keeps saying nothing about web logic.

Before calling a task done: `npm run verify`. Before opening a pull request, also a clean install
the way CI does it (`npm ci` in the root and in each package), then `verify` again.

## Structure

- Root: shared tooling (Prettier, ESLint, commitlint, lint-staged, gitleaks), `.githooks/`,
  `.claude/`, `specs/`.
- `api/src/<module>/`: controller (thin) → service (logic) → Prisma. Imports go downward only.
  Generated Prisma client in `api/src/generated/` (git-ignored, never edited by hand).
- `web/`: `app/` holds routing only and re-exports pages from `src/_pages`. FSD layers in `web/src/`,
  imports only downward: `_app → _pages → widgets → features → entities → shared`.
- `deploy/`: production compose files, nginx, deploy scripts, Ansible (server setup).

## Docker (local development)

- The app runs in Docker: `docker compose up -d --wait` (quick start in `README.md`). Do not run
  api or web natively against the compose services, or two copies end up fighting over ports.
- `.env` (git-ignored, created by `scripts/init-env.sh`) holds local values; every variable is
  listed in `.env.example`. Claude cannot read `.env` (settings deny it) and does not need to.
- Sources are bind-mounted; rebuild an image (`docker compose up -d --build <service>`) only after
  a dependency or config change. After a Prisma schema change:
  `docker compose run --rm api npx prisma generate`.
- Images: multi-stage, exact base-image versions, non-root user, exec-form `CMD`, dependencies
  installed before sources are copied. Secrets never go into an image (`ARG`/`ENV`/`COPY`); the
  web build takes the Sentry token as a BuildKit secret.
- Containers reach each other by service name, never `localhost`; addresses come from compose.
  Startup order uses health checks with `depends_on: service_healthy`, never sleeps.
- `docker compose down -v` and `docker volume rm/prune` delete data; the guard hook blocks them.
  The owner runs them by hand.

## Conventions

- `api` is an ESM package: relative imports end in `.js`.
- Configuration comes from validated environment variables (zod schemas), never hard-coded
  addresses; containers reach each other by service name.
- Logging: `api` through the injected pino logger, never `console` (ESLint enforces it).
- `web` calls the api from the server only through `apiFetch` (`web/src/shared/api`): it forwards
  the visitor's address, so the api's per-client rate limit applies to the visitor and not to the
  web container. A direct `fetch` to the api would put all visitors into one limit.
- `web` data from the api renders at request time inside `<Suspense>`: the web image must build with
  no api, Redis or database running.
- Every new environment variable goes into `.env.example` with a comment.
- Migrations stay compatible with the previous release: add in one release, remove in a later one.
  A bad migration is fixed by rolling forward.

## Production and deploys

Details and commands: `deploy/README.md`.

- A merge into `main` is the deploy: CI (secret scan, `verify`, images built and a blue-green deploy
  checked on the runner, published to GHCR) → CD (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`) → the server runs
  `deploy/scripts/deploy.sh <commit hash>`. Rollback: run CD by hand with an earlier hash.
- Blue-green: the new copy of api and web starts next to the running one, nginx switches only when
  it is healthy; the previous copy stays as the rollback. The Temporal worker is replaced in place.
- Every change to deploy files is tested the way it reaches production: on a copy of `deploy/`
  updated as CD updates the server, and in CI by `scripts/ci-deploy-check.sh`. nginx config changes
  are applied by `deploy.sh` without restarting nginx.
- The server's `.env` is rewritten from GitHub on every deploy; values change in GitHub, not on the
  server. Production secrets never pass through the chat.
- Migrations must stay compatible with the running version (`specs/principles.md`): a rollback does
  not undo them.
- The server is reached as `ssh ai-fitting` (the owner's SSH alias); CI logs in as `deploy`.
  Commands that change the server need the owner's confirmation.

## Dependencies

- Check a package before adding it (rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md`). Plain `npm ci` must work: never
  `--legacy-peer-deps`. The only peer-range exception is an `overrides` entry in
  `api/package.json` for `@nest-lab/throttler-storage-redis` (declares Nest ≤ 11, runs on 12);
  remove it once a release supports Nest 12. A new exception needs the owner's decision.
- npm 12 blocks install scripts that are not approved. Approve only what needs one
  (`npm install-scripts approve <pkg>`), and say why in the commit.
- ESLint and its plugins live only in the root `package.json`.

## Git

- Commits: `type(scope): subject`, subject lower-case. Types: feat, fix, perf, refactor, style,
  test, docs, build, ci, chore, revert. Scope required: api, web, infra, deploy, ci, deps, docs,
  specs, tooling.
- No `Co-Authored-By` lines in commit messages.
- Hooks: pre-commit (lint-staged, then gitleaks on staged changes), commit-msg (commitlint),
  pre-push (`npm run verify`). Never skip them; `.claude/hooks/guard-bash.sh` blocks `--no-verify`.
- The guard reads a Bash command's text, so a `grep` for a blocked phrase is blocked too: search
  files with the Grep/Read tools, and write such text with the editor, not with `cat <<EOF`.
- A gitleaks hit is a real secret until proven otherwise: unstage it. Only a value confirmed to be a
  placeholder goes into the `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist, with a description.
- One branch and pull request per phase of `tasks.md`; merged with "Rebase and merge".
  After a merge, start the next branch from a fresh `main`.
